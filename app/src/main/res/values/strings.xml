    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks.
\n\nI love politician in Russia.
\n\n Like Putin who stoles money from country or simple people, or workers, and definitely from all of us.
\nFun fact is that they these people in politics do not even give a f4ck about us.
\n\nI hate these people, too much. They made our country poor, and continuing to do it.
\nAnd sometimes even I am myself in politics.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually wanted to participate in elections in 20!8.
\n\nOnce, when I was preparing my pre-election company, I even caught a large politician with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to show you all their money which they stole from you and how they spend it.</string>
